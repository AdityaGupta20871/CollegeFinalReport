## Abstract

The TrustEscrow project implements a decentralized escrow system leveraging blockchain technology to facilitate secure transactions between untrusting parties. The system integrates multi-signature functionality, milestone-based payments, and third-party arbitration to ensure fair exchanges while eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries. This report details the development, implementation, and evaluation of the TrustEscrow platform, which consists of Solidity smart contracts deployed on Ethereum-compatible networks and a modern React-based frontend interface that enables users to create, manage, and interact with escrow contracts.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Traditional escrow services suffer from several limitations, including high fees, geographical restrictions, and dependency on centralized intermediaries that must be trusted by all parties involved. These intermediaries often have the power to freeze funds, impose arbitrary rules, and present single points of failure.

Blockchain technology offers an opportunity to reimagine escrow services by providing trustless execution of predefined rules, transparent transaction history, and immutable records. By implementing escrow logic in smart contracts, we can create a system that operates without requiring trust in any central authority while ensuring that funds are only released when predefined conditions are met.

### 1.2 Objectives

The primary objectives of the TrustEscrow project are:

1. Develop a secure, decentralized escrow system using blockchain technology
2. Implement milestone-based payment functionality to reduce transaction risk
3. Create a third-party arbitration mechanism to resolve disputes
4. Design a user-friendly interface to interact with escrow contracts
5. Ensure the system is resistant to common smart contract vulnerabilities
6. Provide transparent fee structures and transaction histories

### 1.3 Project Overview

TrustEscrow is a decentralized application (DApp) that enables users to create, manage, and participate in escrow agreements without requiring trust in a centralized intermediary. The system consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity and deployed on Ethereum-compatible networks, these contracts handle the core escrow logic, including fund management, milestone tracking, and dispute resolution.

2. **Factory Contract**: A contract that creates and keeps track of individual escrow contracts, making them discoverable and manageable.

3. **Web Interface**: A React-based frontend application that provides users with an intuitive way to interact with the smart contracts, create new escrows, and manage existing ones.

The platform supports key features such as:
- Multi-signature confirmations for milestones
- Time-locked contracts with automatic cancellation options
- Milestone-based payment release
- Third-party arbitration for dispute resolution
- Dashboard for tracking all escrow contracts

## 2. Literary Survey

Escrow services have been a critical component of commerce for centuries, acting as trusted intermediaries to facilitate transactions between parties that may not fully trust each other. Traditional escrow services are typically provided by financial institutions, legal firms, or specialized escrow companies. However, these centralized solutions come with several drawbacks:

1. **High Fees**: Traditional escrow services often charge substantial fees, typically 1-5% of the transaction value.
2. **Geographical Limitations**: Many escrow services operate only within specific jurisdictions.
3. **Processing Delays**: Manual verification and processing can lead to significant delays.
4. **Centralized Trust**: Users must trust the escrow provider to act honestly and securely store funds.

With the advent of blockchain technology, new approaches to escrow services have emerged. Notable existing solutions include:

- **Bitrated**: An early Bitcoin-based trust platform that introduced multi-signature wallets for escrow purposes.
- **OpenBazaar**: A decentralized marketplace with built-in moderated payments using multi-signature Bitcoin transactions.
- **Arwen Protocol**: A layer-2 solution enabling secure trading on centralized exchanges using escrow contracts.

Academic research in this area has focused on several key aspects:

1. **Smart Contract Security**: Researchers have identified common vulnerabilities in smart contract implementations, including reentrancy attacks, integer overflow/underflow, and timestamp dependencies.
2. **Formal Verification**: Methods to mathematically prove the correctness of smart contract implementations.
3. **Privacy-Preserving Escrow**: Techniques to implement escrow functionality while preserving transaction privacy.
4. **Scalability Solutions**: Layer-2 protocols that enable more efficient escrow transactions without compromising security.

However, existing solutions often lack user-friendly interfaces, milestone-based payment systems, or efficient dispute resolution mechanisms. The TrustEscrow project aims to address these limitations by providing a comprehensive escrow solution that leverages the security of blockchain while offering an intuitive user experience.

## 3. Implementation of Proposed Method

### 3.1 Algorithm Overview

#### 3.1.1 Program Logic

The TrustEscrow system implements several key algorithms to ensure secure, fair, and transparent escrow transactions:

**Escrow Creation Algorithm**:
1. Buyer initiates an escrow contract through the factory
2. Specifies participants (buyer, seller, optional additional observers)
3. Defines required confirmation threshold
4. Defines timelock period
5. Splits total amount into milestone payments
6. Deposits full amount (plus platform fee) into the contract
7. Contract is deployed and initialized in "Active" state

**Milestone Confirmation Algorithm**:
1. Seller completes work for a milestone
2. Participants review the work
3. Each participant can confirm the milestone completion
4. System tracks confirmation count
5. When confirmation threshold is reached, funds for milestone are released
6. Current milestone index is incremented

**Dispute Resolution Algorithm**:
1. Any participant can initiate a dispute
2. Contract state changes to "Disputed"
3. Factory contract assigns an arbitrator based on reputation
4. Arbitrator reviews evidence
5. Arbitrator makes a decision (in favor of buyer or seller)
6. Contract executes the decision:
   - If in favor of seller: Remaining funds released to seller
   - If in favor of buyer: Remaining funds returned to buyer

**Timelock Cancellation Algorithm**:
1. System checks if current time exceeds timelock
2. If timelock has passed and contract is still active:
   - Any participant can trigger cancellation
   - Remaining funds are returned to the buyer
   - Contract state changes to "Cancelled"

#### 3.1.2 Tech Stacks Used

The TrustEscrow project employs a modern full-stack development approach, utilizing the following technologies:

**Smart Contract Development**:
- **Solidity**: Programming language for Ethereum smart contracts
- **Foundry**: Development framework for testing and deploying smart contracts
- **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**: Execution environment for smart contracts

**Frontend Development**:
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript for improved developer experience
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for faster development
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library for building accessible and customizable UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

### 3.2 Blockchain

The TrustEscrow system leverages blockchain technology to provide a trustless and transparent escrow service. Key blockchain-related components include:

**Smart Contracts**:
Three main smart contracts form the core of the system:
1. **TrustEscrow.sol**: The main escrow contract that handles fund management, milestone tracking, and participant confirmations.
2. **TrustEscrowFactory.sol**: Factory contract that creates and manages TrustEscrow instances.
3. **Arbitration.sol**: Contract that handles dispute resolution and arbitrator management.

**Blockchain Features Utilized**:
- **Immutability**: Once created, escrow terms cannot be altered, ensuring all parties are bound by the initial agreement.
- **Transparency**: All transactions and state changes are recorded on the blockchain and visible to participants.
- **Programmable Money**: Smart contracts automatically handle fund deposits and disbursements based on predefined rules.
- **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the escrow funds or can unilaterally modify the terms.

**Network Compatibility**:
The system is designed to work with Ethereum and Ethereum-compatible networks such as:
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Ethereum Testnet (Sepolia, Goerli)
- Local development networks (Anvil, Hardhat)

### 3.3 Problem Specifications

The TrustEscrow project addresses several key challenges in digital transactions:

**Trust Issues**:
- Buyers are reluctant to pay upfront for goods or services they haven't received
- Sellers are unwilling to deliver without payment assurance
- Traditional escrows require trust in a centralized third party

**Payment Flexibility**:
- Large transactions benefit from milestone-based approaches
- Need for partial payments based on completion stages
- Support for multi-party confirmation of milestones

**Dispute Resolution**:
- Mechanism for handling disagreements between parties
- Need for impartial third-party arbitration
- Fair distribution of funds based on dispute outcome

**Transparency Requirements**:
- All parties need visibility into transaction status
- Clear record of confirmations and releases
- Transparent fee structure

**Security Concerns**:
- Prevention of unauthorized fund access
- Protection against smart contract vulnerabilities
- Ensuring funds are only released according to predefined conditions
